<!--
Actually the code is confusing...
but what should happend here is 
1- 'Task 1 to execution' should be printed on the console
then on the 12th line 'execute' function is called with 'print' function and callback time is given as 2000 milli secs
2- 'Task 2 to execution' is printed on the console
then on the 15th line 'execute' function is called with 'print' function and callback time is given as 2000 milli secs
3- 'Task 3 to execute' is prints on the console
then on the 18th line 'execute' function is called with 'print' function and callback time is given as 500 milli secs
4- 'Last code line executed' should e prints on the console
then the callback should work by now so according to the times given
'Task 3 Finished'
'Task 1 Finished'
'Task 2 Finished' 
Should prints on the console
